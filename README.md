**Title: Shakespearean Text Generator with TensorFlow**

**Description:**

This project uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) to generate text in the style of Shakespeare. The model is trained on a dataset composed of Shakespeare's writings.

The main script, `text_generator.py`, accomplishes the following:

1. **Data Preparation**: Downloads a file of Shakespeare's text, reads the text and preprocesses it, and converts characters to integers.

2. **Model Definition**: Defines a custom model class using TensorFlow's Keras API. The model architecture includes an Embedding layer, a GRU layer, and a Dense layer.

3. **Model Training**: Compiles the model and trains it on the prepared data. The model's weights are saved in checkpoints after each epoch.

4. **Text Generation**: Defines a custom model for generating text one character at a time. The model generates a piece of text starting with `'ROMEO:'` and consisting of 1000 characters.

The `requirements.txt` file contains a list of Python dependencies required to run the script. To install the required packages, use the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

This project is an excellent demonstration of using RNNs for sequence data like text. It showcases how to use TensorFlow for defining, training, and using a text generation model.
